# 🫀 HeartGuard AI: Cardiac Risk Prediction App

## 📌 Project Overview
HeartGuard AI is a machine learning application designed to assess the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on clinical metrics. Built with **PyTorch** for deep learning and **Streamlit** for the interactive user interface, this tool mimics a real-world medical diagnostic assistant.

## 🚀 Features
- **Deep Learning Model:** Powered by a neural network trained on the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset.
- **Real-Time Analysis:** Instant risk probability scoring (0% to 100%).
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Adjust age, blood pressure, cholesterol, and other vitals via sliders.
- **Medical Logic:** Implements standard data scaling (normalization) to ensure accurate predictions across different patient demographics.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** (Logic)
- **PyTorch** (Neural Network Training & Inference)
- **Streamlit** (Web Interface)
- **NumPy** (Data Processing)

Install dependencies:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the application:

Bash

streamlit run app.py
